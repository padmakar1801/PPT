In Java, both List and Set are interfaces that are part of the Collection framework and are used to store collections of objects. However, there are key differences between List and Set in terms of their characteristics and the way they handle elements. Here are the main differences:

1. Order: List maintains the order of elements based on their insertion, while Set does not guarantee any specific order of elements. List allows duplicate elements, and their order can be accessed and manipulated using index-based methods, such as get(), set(), and remove(). Set, on the other hand, does not allow duplicates, and the order of elements is implementation-dependent.

2. Duplication: List allows duplicate elements, meaning you can have multiple instances of the same object within the list. Set, on the other hand, does not allow duplicates. If an attempt is made to add a duplicate element to a Set, it will simply be ignored, as the set already contains an equivalent element.

3. Equality: List considers elements as equal if they have the same value. It uses the equals() method to determine equality. Set, on the other hand, determines equality based on the equals() and hashCode() methods. Two elements in a Set are considered equal if their hashCode values are the same and their equals() method returns true.

4. Performance: List provides efficient positional access to elements using index-based methods. Accessing an element by index in a List is a constant time operation (O(1)). However, searching for an element within a List requires iterating through the elements sequentially, which can take linear time (O(n)). Set, on the other hand, is optimized for fast membership checks. Searching for an element within a Set is typically faster (O(1) or O(log n), depending on the implementation) compared to List.
