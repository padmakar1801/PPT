1. Execution Process:
   - Compiler: A compiler takes the entire source code as input and translates it into an executable file or another form of code that can be directly executed by the computer's hardware. The resulting executable file can be executed multiple times without the need for recompilation.
   - Interpreter: An interpreter, on the other hand, directly executes the source code line by line. It reads one line of code, translates it into machine code (or an intermediate representation), and executes it immediately. The process is repeated for each line of code, without generating a separate executable.

2. Translation:
   - Compiler: A compiler performs a complete translation of the source code before the program is executed. It analyzes the entire program, checks for errors, and generates an optimized form of the code (e.g., machine code or bytecode) that can be executed independently.
   - Interpreter: An interpreter translates and executes the source code line by line. It typically performs some analysis and error-checking at runtime. Each line of code is translated and executed just-in-time (JIT) as it is encountered.

3. Execution Speed:
   - Compiler: Due to the upfront translation and optimization process, compiled programs generally execute faster than interpreted programs. The compiled code is usually directly executed by the computer's hardware, resulting in efficient execution.
   - Interpreter: Interpreted programs, by nature, tend to have slower execution speeds compared to compiled programs. The interpretation process incurs additional overhead at runtime as each line of code is translated and executed.

4. Portability:
   - Compiler: Compiled programs are typically platform-specific, as the generated executable code is tailored to the target hardware and operating system. To run the compiled program on different platforms, it may require recompilation for each target platform.
   - Interpreter: Interpreted programs are generally more portable since the interpreter itself abstracts the underlying hardware. As long as the interpreter is available for the target platform, the same source code can be executed without modification.
