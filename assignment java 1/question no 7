In Java, variables are used to store and manipulate data within a program. There are several types of variables in Java, which can be categorized into the following main groups:

1. Local Variables:
   Local variables are declared and used within a specific block of code, typically within a method, constructor, or a block statement. They are accessible only within the scope where they are defined. Local variables must be explicitly initialized before they can be used, and they are destroyed once the block of code is executed.

2. Instance Variables (Non-Static Variables):
   Instance variables, also known as non-static variables, are declared within a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. Each instance of the class (object) has its own copy of instance variables, which are created when an object is instantiated. Instance variables are accessible throughout the entire class and can have different values for each instance of the class.

3. Class Variables (Static Variables):
   Class variables, also known as static variables, are declared with the `static` keyword within a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. Unlike instance variables, class variables are associated with the class itself, not with specific instances of the class. There is only one copy of a class variable shared by all instances of the class. Class variables are initialized only once when the class is loaded and remain in memory throughout the program's execution.

4. Parameters:
   Parameters are variables declared in the method or constructor signature and used to pass values to methods or constructors. They allow data to be passed from the caller to the method or constructor. Parameters act as local variables within the method or constructor and have their own scope and lifetime.
