In Java, there are two ways to implement threads:

1. Extending the `Thread` class:
   - One way to implement threads is by creating a subclass of the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.
   - The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed in the thread.
   - To start the thread, you create an instance of the subclass and call the `start()` method, which internally calls the `run()` method.
   - Here's an example:

   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           // Code to be executed in the thread
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyThread thread = new MyThread();
           thread.start();
       }
   }
   ```

2. Implementing the `Runnable` interface:
   - Another way to implement threads is by implementing the `Runnable` interface and providing the implementation for its `run()` method.
   - The `Runnable` interface represents a task that can be executed by a thread.
   - To start the thread, you create an instance of a class implementing `Runnable`, and then create a `Thread` object, passing the `Runnable` instance to its constructor. Finally, you call the `start()` method on the `Thread` object.
   - Here's an example:

   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           // Code to be executed in the thread
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
           Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
           thread.start();
       }
   }
   ```

Both approaches allow you to create and start threads, but the second approach of implementing the `Runnable` interface is generally preferred because it offers more flexibility. Implementing `Runnable` allows you to separate the task (runnable object) from the thread (thread object), promoting better separation of concerns and code reusability.

It's worth noting that Java also provides higher-level concurrency utilities, such as `Executors` and `ThreadPoolExecutor`, which simplify the management of threads and provide additional features for task scheduling and thread pooling.
