1. Equality Operators:
   - `==` (Equal to): Checks if two operands are equal in value.
   - `!=` (Not equal to): Checks if two operands are not equal in value.

2. Relational Operators:
   - `<` (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
   - `>` (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
   - `<=` (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

3. Conditional Logical Operators:
   - `&&` (Logical AND): Returns true if both the left and right operands are true.
   - `||` (Logical OR): Returns true if either the left or right operand is true.

4. Ternary Operator:
   - `? :` (Conditional operator): Evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on the result of the condition. It has the form `condition ? expression1 : expression2`. If the condition is true, `expression1` is evaluated; otherwise, `expression2` is evaluated.
