In Spring MVC, the Model represents the data and state of an application that is used by the controller to prepare and provide data to the view for rendering. It acts as a container for data that needs to be displayed or manipulated in the user interface.

The Model in Spring MVC is typically a Java object or a data structure that holds the application's data. It can be a simple JavaBean, a collection, or a custom data transfer object (DTO). The primary responsibility of the Model is to provide data to the view layer for rendering.

The Model object is created and managed by the Spring MVC framework and is automatically passed to the controller methods as a method parameter. It is usually represented by the `Model` interface or its implementation classes, such as `ModelMap` or `ExtendedModelMap`.

The Model is used by the controller to add attributes or data that will be accessed by the view. The controller populates the Model with the necessary data and then returns a logical view name along with the Model object to the DispatcherServlet.

The DispatcherServlet resolves the logical view name to an actual view implementation (such as a JSP, Thymeleaf template, or JSON response) and makes the Model data available to the view for rendering. The view can access the Model data using expression languages or specific view technologies to generate the desired output.

The Model plays a crucial role in the MVC pattern by facilitating the communication between the controller and the view. It allows the controller to prepare the necessary data and pass it to the view, enabling the separation of concerns between data processing and view rendering.

Here's an example illustrating the usage of the Model in Spring MVC:

```java
@Controller
public class ExampleController {

    @GetMapping("/example")
    public String handleRequest(Model model) {
        // Add data to the Model
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, Spring MVC!");

        // Return the logical view name
        return "exampleView";
    }
}
```
